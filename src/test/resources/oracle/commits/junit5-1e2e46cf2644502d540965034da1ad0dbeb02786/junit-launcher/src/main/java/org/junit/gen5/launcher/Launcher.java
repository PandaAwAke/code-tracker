/**
 * The {@code Launcher} API is the main entry point for client code that
 * wishes to <em>discover</em> and <em>execute</em> tests using one or more
 * {@linkplain org.junit.gen5.engine.TestEngine test engines}.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface are responsible for determining
 * the set of test engines to delegate to at runtime. For example, the
 * {@link org.junit.gen5.launcher.main.DefaultLauncher DefaultLauncher}
 * dynamically registers test engines via Java's
 * {@link java.util.ServiceLoader ServiceLoader} mechanism.
 *
 * <p>Discovery and execution of tests require a {@link TestDiscoveryRequest}
 * which is passed to all registered engines. Each engine decides which tests
 * it can discover and later execute according to the {@link TestDiscoveryRequest}.
 *
 * <p>Clients of this interface may optionally call {@link #discover} prior to
 * {@link #execute} in order to inspect the {@link TestPlan} before executing
 * it.
 *
 * <p>Prior to executing tests, clients of this interface should
 * {@linkplain #registerTestExecutionListeners register} one or more
 * {@link TestExecutionListener} instances in order to get feedback about the
 * progress and results of test execution. Listeners will be notified of events
 * in the order in which they were registered.
 *
 * @since 5.0
 * @see TestDiscoveryRequest
 * @see TestPlan
